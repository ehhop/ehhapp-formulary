This document contains tests that look like interactive Python sessions.

These tests can be run from the command line as follows:

`python -m doctest -v test.txt`

Tests are formatted to resemble interactive Python commands
followed by expected return values.

	>>> 1 + 1
	2

Any expected output must immediately follow the final '>>> ' or '... ' line
containing the code, and the expected output extends to the next '>>> ' or
all-whitespace line.
